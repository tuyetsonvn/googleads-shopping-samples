# Google Content API for Shopping Python Samples

This is a set of simple samples written in Python, which provide a minimal
example of Google Shopping integration within a command line application.

This starter project provides a great place to start your experimentation into
the Google Content API for Shopping.

## Prerequisites

Please make sure that you've installed the [Google APIs Client Library for
Python](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/start/installation),
the [Google Auth Python
Library](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-auth-library-python),
[google-auth-oauthlib](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/google-auth-oauthlib), and
[google-auth-httplib2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/google-auth-httplib2).
The samples should be compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3.

For your convenience, you can run the following command from this directory to
install all needed dependencies via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/):

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

## Setup Authentication and Sample Configuration

If you have not already done so, please read the top-level `README` to discover
how to set up both authentication and the common sample configuration. The rest
of this document assumes you have performed both tasks.

## Running the Samples

We are assuming you've checked out the code and are reading this from a local
directory. If not, check out the code to a local directory.

1.  Start up a sample:

        $ python -m shopping.content.products.list

1.  Examine your shell output, be inspired and start hacking an amazing new app!
