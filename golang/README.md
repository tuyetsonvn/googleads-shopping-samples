# Google Content API for Shopping Go Samples

This is a set of simple samples written in Go, which provide a minimal
example of Google Shopping integration within a command line application.

This starter project provides a great place to start your experimentation into
the Google Content API for Shopping.

## Prerequisites

Please make sure that you have Go installed and that you've installed
the [Google APIs Client Library for Go]
(https://github.com/google/google-api-go-client) as well as the [OAuth Library
for Go](https://github.com/golang/oauth2) and its support for
interfacing with Google APIs:

        $ go get golang.org/x/oauth2
        $ go get golang.org/x/oauth2/google
        $ go get google.golang.org/api/content/v2.1

This code also uses the [browser](https://github.com/pkg/browser) package
to open the authentication URL in your browser automatically and the
support package for Google's protocol buffers:

        $ go get github.com/pkg/browser
        $ go get github.com/golang/protobuf/proto

Finally, this code uses the backoff package to handle retries:

        $ go get github.com/cenkalti/backoff

## Setup Authentication and Sample Configuration

If you have not already done so, please read the top-level `README` to discover
how to set up both authentication and the common sample configuration.  The rest
of this document assumes you have performed both tasks.

## Running the Samples

We are assuming you've checked out the code and are reading this from a local
directory. If not, check out the code to a local directory.

1. Compile all the sample code in the directory together:

        $ go build -o content-api-demo *.go

2. Run the resulting binary to get an idea of its usage:

        $ ./content-api-demo -h

3. Pick a demo (or demos) to run, for example:

        $ ./content-api-demo products accounts

   If no demos are selected on the command line, then all demos except for the
   Orders demo will be run.

4. Examine your shell output, be inspired and start hacking an amazing new app!
